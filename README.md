# Contentful extensions samples
This repository shows samples of Contentful extensions using the [UI Extensions SDK](https://github.com/contentful/ui-extensions-sdk).

Each example comes with a README file explaining how to build and use it. They're showing various types of integrations with popular frameworks or build systems like:
- npm
- Gulp
- Makefile
- Webpack
- Babel

Please remember that most of them require you to host their dependencies on your own server which supports CORS and is available in HTTPS in order to be used outside your local environment.
